<p class="lead">About GallowayNow</p>


<h4>Who</h4>

<p>GallowayNow is maintained by <a href="http://michael.thegrebs.com/">Michael Greb</a>,
  a Galloway resident.  I work for <a href="http://www.ziprecruiter.com/">ZipRecruiter.com</a>
  as a Software Engineer.  As a software developer and someone interested in my town,
  I wrote software to generate the web pages shown now at GallowayNow over the course
  of a year.  I realized that I had begun to amass a small collection
  of Galloway centric web pages that might be useful to other residents, I purchased
  the domain name then cleaned up and unified the isolated pages I had made into
  what is now GallowayNow.</p>

<h4>The Software</h4>

<p>The software used to create GallowayNow is
  <a href="http://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Software</a>.  Which
  means it is freely available to anyone to use or modify as they wish.  The
  full source and log of changes to the code are available on
  <a href="https://github.com/mikegrb/GallowayNow">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h4>The Hardware</h4>
<p>The site is served by a <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode.com</a> server
  (Linode is also Galloway Township based).  The live audio feed comes from a
  <a href="http://www.uniden.com/scanners/homepatrol-1-simple-program-scanner/invt/homepatrol1g">Uniden HP-1</a>
  scanner at my home connected to a netbook that encodes and streams the audio
  to the Linode for serving.</p>

<h4>Site Status</h4>
<p>Site status is available via the external monitoring service
  <a href="http://pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a> at
